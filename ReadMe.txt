TODO:
* Comments!
* Parser for XML
* Stream for binary
* Stream for (optimized) binary
* Stream for gzip'd binary
* Move data in Value/Object/Array to private
* Support for more number types?
	* JSON could denote the difference between float and int, but no other
	* XML could denote as much as we like
	* binary and optimized binary would benefit the most from the smaller number of bits
